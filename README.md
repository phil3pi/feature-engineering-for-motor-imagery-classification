# Feature engineering for motor imagery classification
This repo contains the code for my Bachelor-Thesis: `Feature engineering for motor imagery classification`.

## Setup
Make sure that every necessary Toolbox is installed before executing the code. A list of all needed Toolboxes can be found [here](https://github.com/phil3pi/feature-engineering-for-motor-imagery-classification/tree/main/docs/used-toolboxes.md).

## Run the code
In order to reproduce the results generated in figures run the code located in `src/main.m `. The `src/base_code.m` file indicates the base version of the bachelor's project - you don't have to execute that. Please make sure that the folder you are located in is the `src-folder`. Located in a different folder leads to an error in loading the dataset, due to wrong relative path.

## Feature Extraction Report
One first comparison of different feature extraction methods is described in a short feature extraction [report](https://github.com/phil3pi/feature-engineering-for-motor-imagery-classification/tree/main/docs/feature-extraction-report/feature_extraction_report.pdf). This report shows first results about the tested extraction methods.
