# Feature engineering for EEG classification
This repo contains the code for my Bachelor-Thesis: `Feature engineering for EEG classification`.

## Run the code
In order to reproduce the results generated in figures run the code located in `src/main.m `. The `src/base_code.m` file indicates the base version of the bachelor's project - you don't have to execute that.

## Feature Extraction Report
One first comparison of different feature extraction methods is described in a short feature extraction [report](https://github.com/phil3pi/feature-engineering-for-eeg-classification/tree/main/docs/feature-extraction-report/feature_extraction_report.pdf). This report shows first results about the tested extraction methods.
